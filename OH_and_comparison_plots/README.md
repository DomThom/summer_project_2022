# Note on files used to get data in the scripts

In the comparison scripts data is often taken from files not stored in the gws, these files were used to transfer processed variables
from the initial analysis files into the same notebook.
Most of the code which created these output files is still there, however if anything appears to be missing it will just be data from
another file which can be put into a NetCDF and transferred over.
